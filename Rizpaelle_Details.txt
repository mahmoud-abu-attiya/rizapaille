About:

RIZPAILLE BY HDR®
The best solution for everybody!

RIZPAILLE by HDR® was inspired by the leaves that surround spring rolls and “white” Asian noodles that are traditionally made of rice dough.

Without any treatment, RIZPAILLE by HDR® undergoes no modification of its initial properties. It has an approximate duration of 30 to 45 minutes in any drink, at room temperature or cold and around 10 minutes in a very hot drink such as Irish Coffee for example.

Features:
Cut by hand, from clean and reasonable crops, RIZPAILLE by HDR® rice always comes from small plantations in order to offer the fairest possible alternative.
For health reasons, we do not recommend the reuse of RIZPAILLE by HDR® straws.
